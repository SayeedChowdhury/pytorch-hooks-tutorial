A crash course on PyTorch hooks. A companion for my Medium post at LINK TO BE INSERTED LATER

## Running the notebook
1. Create a new virtual environment.
```
virtualenv /path/to/venv --python /path/to/python3
```
The path of your Python3 interpreter can be found by
```
which python3
```
2. Activate the virtual environment and install the required packages.
```
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Install a Jupyter kernel inside the virtual environment.
```
ipython kernel install --user --name=name-of-your-venv
```
4. Run Jupyter notebook and execute the notebook.
